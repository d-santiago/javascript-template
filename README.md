# JavaScript Template (2023)

This is a basic template for starting a new JavaScript project. It includes automated testing, using Jest, automated linting, using ESLint, and a continuous integration pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## To install dependencies
    npm install or npm run dev

## To test code locally (using Jest)
    npm run test

## To lint code locally (using ESLint)
    npm run lint

## To fix linting errors
    npm run lint:fix

## Automated Building and Testing: GitHub Actions
Each time that code is pushed to this repository, GitHub Actions builds the project, if applicable, and runs all tests using npm.
